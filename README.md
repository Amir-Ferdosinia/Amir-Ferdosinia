Hello, I'm Amir. I'm a data analyst with a background in Industrial (Systems) Engineering and a focus on systems optimisation and leveraging data science to uncover insights, build predictive models, and support strategic decision-making. Over the years, I‚Äôve led and contributed to a variety of projects, both in professional environments and academic settings, across sectors such as FMCG, marketing and advertising, and non-profits, leveraging large and complex datasets to provide actionable insights that help organisations make data-driven decisions and meet their KPIs.

My experience covers the full data lifecycle: collecting, cleaning, model building, and analysing data, as well as building intuitive dashboards and automated reports using tools like Python, SQL Server, Minitab, Excel, and Power BI.

My problem-solving and critical thinking skills have helped me in spotting patterns and trends in data and turning raw numbers into meaningful insights that support business goals. Whether it's through statistical modelling, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, or visualisation tools, I aim to identify opportunities for improvement. I‚Äôm always looking for ways to add value and contribute to smarter and strategic recommendations and decisions in any team I join.
